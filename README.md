# DSA Visualizer: 

Hey there! 🧋

This project will create a visualization tool for Data Structures and Algorithms. Through this, I hope to create visualizations starting with <i>sorting algorithms</i>, then move my way to data structures — <i>arrays, linkedlists, stacks, queues, trees, BST, AVL trees, graphs...</i>. 🌲

I hope to not only have a visualizer in which we can tell the platform what we wish to see, for example, <i>button to create an empty linked list, then another button to add, remove, search elements...etc</i>

But, also to have a code visualizer! I hope this is able to help students and teachers when it is done. 😄

I built this using Vite and React, virtually learning both from scratch — seems quite interesting though, components and all that 👀

If you have any suggestions on improving or collaborating, feel free to contact me! 👍

# Setup
1. Open your terminal and ensure that `npm` is installed globally on your device. If you haven't installed it yet, you can run the following command to install or update npm:
```md
npm install -g npm
```
2. Check if `git` is installed by running the following command. It will display the Git version if it is already installed; otherwise, it will prompt you to install it:
```md
git --version
```
3. Create a new folder on your device and name it "DSAV" or any name that suits your preference. This folder will be the location for your work.
4. Open your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and navigate to the "DSAV" folder you created. Usually it will be <i><strong>File —> Open —> Choose your File</strong></i>.
5. In your IDE, open an integrated terminal within the "DSAV" folder. <strong>Right Click</strong> within the folder and select <strong><i>"Open in Integrated Terminal."</i></strong>
6. Within the integrated terminal, clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/nguyenv119/DSAV/
```
7. Change your current directory to the "DSAV" folder by running the following command:
```
cd DSAV/
```
8. Install the necesarry modules:
```npm i``` or ```npm install```
9. Finally, run the program with ```npm run dev```
