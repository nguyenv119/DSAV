# DSA Visualizer: 

Hey there! 🧋

This project will create a visualization tool for Data Structures and Algorithms. Through this, I hope to create visualizations starting with <i>sorting algorithms</i>, then move my way to data structures — <i>arrays, linkedlists, stacks, queues, trees, BST, AVL trees, graphs...</i>. 🌲

I hope to not only have a visualizer in which we can tell the platform what we wish to see, for example, <i>button to create an empty linked list, then another button to add, remove, search elements...etc</i>

But, also to have a code visualizer! I hope this is able to help students and teachers when it is done. 😄

I built this using Vite and React, virtually learning both from scratch — seems quite interesting though, components and all that 👀

git --version
```
3. Create a new folder on your device. Name it <i>DSAV</i>, or something that will help you remember the location of your work.
4. Open that folder on your IDE, usually <i><strong>File —> Open —> Choose your File</strong></i>.
5. Open an integrated terminal in your IDE within that file, <strong>Right Click, <i>"Open in Integrated Terminal"</i></strong>.
6. Within your integrated terminal, clone the repositiory:
```
git clone https://github.com/nguyenv119/DSAV/
```
7. Now, move to the correct file by changing your directory:
```
cd DSAV/
```
8. Install the necesarry modules:

9. Finally, run the program with ```npm run dev```
