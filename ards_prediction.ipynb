        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a large language model **refers to the process of further training the pre-trained model on a specific task or domain using a smaller dataset.** The initial pre-training phase involves training a language model on a massive corpus of text data to learn general language patterns and representations. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, customizes the model to a specific task or domain by exposing it to task-specific data. By fine-tuning a large language model on a specific task, you leverage the pre-trained knowledge of the model while tailoring it to the nuances and requirements of your target task. This typically allows the model to perform better and achieve higher accuracy on the specific task compared to using the pretrained model by itself for your specific task.\n",

To make a pre-trained model do better at these specific tasks, we can train it on examples of those tasks. This is called instruction fine-tuning. We use a dataset with pairs of `{instructions, outputs}` in the domain, and this helps the model learn to give the right response when given those types of instructions. This training process typically changes the underlying model weights, but there are also other ways to train it without doing this. When done correctly, this process teaches the model to understand and follow instructions it couldn't handle well before.\n",

The outcome may vary, with the algorithm experiencing heightened error margins in some cases, while in others, it might completely erase the memory of a specific task leading to terrible performance.\n",
